QUTMC Quick is a PVP and building client based on the popular Additive performance pack, it includes compatibility with most optifine features and enhances the gameplay on our server network. This client also includes the server side mods allowing you to use polydecor and such in a singleplayer world.

# ‚≠ê Features

### üîó Integration with QUTMC Club
This modpack is designed to provide a performant and enjoyable experience on our server network. It includes multiple integrations on the server side to this client such as inventory sorting, maps and minimaps, litematica and tweakaroo. It also serves as a baseline for the mods we have approved for usage on the server.

### ü™ë Server mods on client
QUTMC quick includes all of the server side mods from qutmc.club. This means you can play around with chairs, tables, plushies and more as you plan out your next major build in creative or just play with friends!

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Multiplayer features
QUTMC Quick utlizes Axolotl Client and e4mc including a seamless friends system which allows you to join eachothers singleplayer worlds, share screenshots, chats and identify other QUTMC Quick (and Axolotl) users in multiplayer servers.

### üöÄ Major performance improvement

QUTMC Quick is based on [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) which is based on and kept in sync with the [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) modpack. Adrenaline's aim is to significantly improve rendering and game logic performance, along with memory and hardware usage, without compromising on the game's looks or features in any way. This is done with various optimization mods that are actively tested for stability and improvement. Some mods are also pre-configured. Adrenaline wouldn't exist without projects like [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), so I advise you to donate to mod authors and contributors if you can.

For the list of performance mods that are included, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline/wiki/Performance-features).

### üîç OptiFine alternatives

QUTMC Quick includes [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive)'s various mods that offers the same features that OptiFine did while also being modular so that you can remove features you don't want or features that are incompatible with other mods. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Major performance boost from [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline)
- OptiFine resource pack features
- Built-in shaders support
- Dynamic lighting from held objects
- Better grass and snow
- OptiFine donator capes (and [free capes](https://github.com/skywardmc/additive/wiki/Supporter-cape))
- [All OptiFine features and more information on the wiki](https://github.com/skywardmc/additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mod Sourcing
QUTMC Quick attempts to provide mods that make their source available or are open source however there is excpetions such as the Xaero's map mods. You can view the source for QUTMC Quick on our [github](https://github.com/QUT-MC-Club/qmc-quick)

# ‚úÖ Hardware Compatibility

QUTMC Quick supports the use of graphics cards with drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in 2010 or later are compatible. This includes the following hardware:

- Intel HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer
- Nvidia GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer
- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer

In some cases, older graphics cards may also work (as long as they have drivers which support OpenGL 3.3) but they are not officially supported and may not be compatible in the future.

Android devices that use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will likely not work with QUTMC Quick's set of mods. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.

If you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. I also recommend taking a look at [this page](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) on the Sodium wiki.

*The majority of this was taken from Addivites compatibility section which was taken from Sodium's hardware compatibility section. I'll update this accordingly if anything is changed.*
